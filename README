Console Version of a Drawing Program


1. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE - C++


2. COMPILING & RUNNING 

The code was tested: 

- on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with gcc 4.8.4, I attached the makefile) :
	- compile: “make” or “g++ console_drawing.cpp –o console_drawing”
	- run: “./console_drawing”

- using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010


3. IMPLEMENTATION

The canvas is treated as a matrix with h lines and w columns of maximum size 100. Two more lines and two more columns were added for the frame of the canvas. The draw area lines are between 1 and h and the columns are between 1 and w. 
The coordinates of the frame inside the matrix are lines/columns 0, h+1 and w+1, so the user can choose coordinates with values between 1 and w, respectively 1 and h.

In the file test.txt I wrote commands that check all the considered situations, valid or not. To run the test choose the command “T”. 

The command (given by the user or read from the test file) is considered a string that is parsed, using sstream and considering “ “ as a separator. The first element of the string gives the name of the command. Depending on the command, the next parameters are extracted from the string in function doCommands. 

For each command except Q (Quit) and T (used for test) were implemented separate functions. For implementing “Q”, I defined a Boolean variable nextComm that has to be true for the next command to be accepted. When the command is “Q”, nextComm becomes false.

The other required commands are defined in the functions:

- void newCanavas(int w, int h) for C w h : Creates a new canvas with the w and h sizes. A frame was added that doesn't affect the drawing area. Possible considered error: the sizes of the canvas are smaller or equal with 0.

- void drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) for L x1 y1 x2 y2 : Draws a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using the lineChar character (I used “x”). Possible considered errors are: the line is not vertical or horizontal, the 2 points are identical, the line is outside the drawing area (that includes also the edge of the canvas)

- void drawRectangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) for R x1 y1 x2 y2 : creates a new rectangle. It uses the drawLine function to draw the 4 lines of the rectangle. Possible considered errors: (x1,y1) is not the upper left corner and (x2,y2)is not the lower right corner, the coordinates are outside the drawing area.

- void fillArea(int x, int y, char c) for B x y c : fills area connected to the point (x, y) only  if the point belongs to an empty space, not to a line or to a rectangle line. Then it recursively checks the 8 neighbouring points of (x, y). Possible considered errors:the point is outside the drawing area, the point belongs to a line or rectangle, the point is already coloured in colour c
